#		How to read this
If you wandered in here out of curiosity, this is my working notes file, and completed/planned feature list. It's in Markdown, but best viewed in raw form since a lot of its organization has to do with text characters' alignment.

Listed in order of Parent tier summary symbol priority:
	C, T = Code this, Test this
	H = Hold, usually pending resolution of a separate or grouped issue
	√ = Fully implemented feature or group of features
