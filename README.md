#		Resistance HR
Congratulations on your new position in the Human Resources Department! We are reasonably excited to work with you! 

Below is the Recruit Assessment Worksheet, which will outline the procedures and regulations to follow during your employment. Please note that you are not eligible for health coverage until you have been employed for 90 days. Try not to get mauled to death by a gorilla!

No, seriously. **Stay away from the West Garage.**

#		Recruit Assessment Worksheet
Analyze the traits of your prospective recruit according to the subsections below. The Resistance has graded each of these traits with a Point Inference Value (PIV) that will help assess the Applicant's aptitude.

*N.b.: Generally, "+" trait classifications are not available to applicants and must be designated through the course of their tenure in the Resistance. They are still listed here in order to project Upgrade Machine costs.*

Some sections have additional Compliance Chip settings. If you think the applicant might need some extra guidance (they're a scumbag), notify the IT team and they'll ensure the chip is fully configured before you jam it into the applicant's skull.

##			Acquisitional Aptitude
One of the best things in an applicant is how much loot they can score. Uh, don't tell people that.

|Trait								|PIV	|Effects|
|:----------------------------------|------:|:------|
|Bomb Smuggler						|
|Drug Smuggler						|
|Loadout Smuggler					|
|Supply Smuggler					|	7	|- Each level contains a Crate with some items from your character loadout.

##			Close Combat Skills
We hate to say it, but KILL KILL KILL! Combat skills are essential for most recruits not clever enough to think of other ways of doing things.

###				Enchanted Hands
Per new regulations: If the applicant's hands are glowing, do not shake their hand. Do an elbow-bump or something. You don't want a demon in your hands, I missed a whole week of work that way.

|Trait								|PIV	|Notes	|
|:----------------------------------|------:|:------|
|Cursed Fist						|      3|- Unarmed attacks can hit Ghosts<br>- Unarmed damage to all Mundane agents increased by 25%
|Cursed Fist +						|      5|- Unarmed & Melee attacks can hit Ghosts<br>- Unarmed & Melee damage to all Mundane agents increased by 50%<br>- Applies Unlucky status effect to non-Supernatural agents

|Spectral Palm +					|	   5|- Unarmed & Melee attacks can hit Ghosts<br>- Unarmed & Melee damage to all Supernatural agents increased by 100%

##			Contract Negotiation
Even if the applicant is a fucking idiot, they're probably going to have preferences about what they do for the Resistance. And believe me, if they're signing up you can be sure about one of those things.

###				Remuneration
Not everyone wants to be paid the same way. I even heard they pay people in gum.

|Trait								|PIV	|Quest XP	|Quest Rewards	|

##			Inventory Management
An applicant's handling of their money and other assets will be a good clue to their reliability. You can quickly assess an applicant's poverty by counting the flies buzzing above their head.
