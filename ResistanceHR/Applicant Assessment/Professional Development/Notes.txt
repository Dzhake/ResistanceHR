Two idea groups:

|Trait							|Trait Weights					
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------|
|  Group A:
|Extra Bonky					|Melee +3				
|Extra Shooty					|Guns +3
|Extra Stealthy					|Stealth +3
|etc.							|

|  Group B:
|Tanky							|Defense +3, Movement -3
|Upstanding						|Social +3, Stealth -3
|Businesslike					|Trade +3, Social -3
|etc.

Using trait weight system would depend on the ability for it to handle duplicates from the same trait, or if it assumes a single category, or at least distinct ones.

They also don't need to use the weight system per se. They could have an automated reject/retry in trait rolls. E.g., mandate at least one choice from the target category on each level up, and prefer it when trait-swapping, and a 50% chance to reject traits from the anti-category.
