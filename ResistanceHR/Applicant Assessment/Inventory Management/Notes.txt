From Streets of Cheese:
	Maintenance Maladjusted: Lose all weapons at the end of the floor.
	Munchies: Lose all healing items at end of floor.
	Agent of DARE: Lose all drugs at the end of the floor.
	Button-Pushing Addict: Lose all consumable items at end of floor.
	Hyperactive: Lose all passives at the end of the floor.
	Tinkerer: like button-pushing, but get back half as many random items afterward.
