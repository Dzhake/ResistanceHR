## Silver Tongue - Special Requests for NPCs
[Note: This was COPIED to RHR. Consider that version to be updated if it still exists.
Request NPCs to do special actions in a much greater variety of situations. Ask them to abuse their power, violate their principles, and cave to your threats.
Mugging and Extortion are examples of Vanilla Special Requests.

### Methods of Requesting

Base chances of outcome, without modifiers.

|Request			|Requirements + % roll  	|Results besides compliance	|Fearful	|Hostile	|Annoyed	|Neutral	|Success	|Notes  |
|:------------------|:--------------------------|--------------------------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|:------|
|Asking Nicely		|Relationship				|Friendly					|5			|10			|50			|5			|30			|
|Bribery			|Money scaled to request	|Friendly					|0			|15			|35			|5			|45			|
|Threat				|None						|Submissive					|25			|50			|10			|5			|35			|

The following increase the *weighted* chance of Success above:
- Luck
- Traits (below)
- Scariness (Sum of you & followers' equipped damage vs. theirs)

The following decrease the *weighted* chance of Success above:
- Severity of request
- Security level of target chunk
- NPC type (Supercops are hard to corrupt) 

- SOME failed checks that result in Hostility can be resolved by making the NPC submissive (A la Extortionist) via:
  - Destroying their Objects & Walls
  - Damaging them and their allies
- Making an NPC submissive 

- NPC reactions to failed Requests are based on Threat and NPC type:
  - Fight to death
  - Fight until beaten, then flee
  - Alarm Button if applicable
  - Fight until beaten, then Submissive
